Capstone project for Foundations 

*NOTE(note from completing requirement):
1.The calculator cannot do negative numbers
2.Extra credit was not completed
Because this is a capstone, I will use this as a portfolio piece. As a beginner I'm hoping to make it look good and go for an extra credit point. Link to requirements
